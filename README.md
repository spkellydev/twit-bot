# twit-bot
This is a twitter bot that I built and deployed to heroku, just for experience

I used the Twit respoitory https://github.com/ttezel/twit

I created this bot just for experience. Currently, it retweets based off a specific hastag, favorites based off a specific query, thanks follower, and replies to a user whenever they tweet at the account

It was pretty fun for a first go around, but I think next time I would try to include some geo tags and more vast search parameters
